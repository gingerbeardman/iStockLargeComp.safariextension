# iStockLargeComp

Adds a download large comp link on iStockphoto.com

## Background

iStockPhoto has a zoom function that lets you view a larger version of the image.  

This involves a targetted click on the centre of the image, and further clicks if you wish to save the large comp to your computer.

In most instances it's not possible to view this zoomed image at its full size, or easily download it for use in your designs.  

## How it works

This extension adds a "Download large comp" link, styled as a green button, that points to the zoomed image.
