iStockLargeComp.safariextension
==============================

Generates a downloadable large comp from the individual zoom tiles on iStockphoto.com

## Background

iStockPhoto has a zoom function that lets you pan around a large version of the image, loading sections of it as you go.  
It's kind of like Google Maps, but with a photo or illustration instead of a map. 

## How it works

This extension loads all the individual zoom tiles, stitches them together as a large image, and gives you a handy download link.  
The process takes a minute or two, but is a lot faster than if you had to do it by hand.

## How to use
Once activated, there will be an extra option underneath the image "Download a large comp":

Clicking on this will begin the three-step generation of the comp:
