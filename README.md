# iStockLargeComp

Changes the download comp link to point to a large comp on iStockphoto.com

## Background

iStockPhoto has a zoom function that lets you pan around a large version of the image, loading larger versions as you zoom in.  
It is no longer split into tiles, but it's kind of like Google Maps with a photo or illustration instead of a map.

## How it works

This extension replaces the standard "Download a Comp" link with a better one that triggers the largest zoom and prompts you with a download.  

## Download

## How to use
Once activated, the option underneath the image will read "Download a Large Comp". You no longer have to be logged in to use this plugin.
